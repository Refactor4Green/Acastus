Acastus-Photon translates name of street/city/point-of-interest
to geo-coordinate which can be

* opened in a map or navigation app such as OsmAnd, Maps.me, APhotoManager.
* shared with other people via the send command.

The Photon-Server-Software which Acastus-Photon calls over the internet
is a replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services that you
can run on your own server.

Details on setting up your own Photon instance are here: https://github.com/komoot/photon
