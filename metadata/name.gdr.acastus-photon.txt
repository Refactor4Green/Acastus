Auto Name:Acastus Photon
Summary:A free and open source address/POI search for navigation apps
Description: |-
    A private, free and open source replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services
    that relies on Photon, which you can run on your own server. It uses the Photon API to fetch results to your phone, allowing
    you to search for places in Acastus Photon. Then open and navigate to the result in your preferred 
    navigation app, such as OsmAnd or Maps.me.

    This is a fork of Acastus by DanielBarnett714, which used the Pelias API.
